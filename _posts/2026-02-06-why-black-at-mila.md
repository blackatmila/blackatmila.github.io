Black at Mila was created to address the need for a dedicated space and community for Black researchers, students, and professionals within the Mila ecosystem. While Mila has established itself as a leading AI research institute, we recognized the importance of creating a supportive network specifically for Black members of the community.

## Building Community and Representation

The field of artificial intelligence, like many STEM disciplines, faces significant challenges when it comes to diversity and representation. Black researchers and students often find themselves navigating spaces where they are underrepresented, which can impact their sense of belonging, access to opportunities, and ability to thrive.

Black at Mila exists to:

- **Create a Supportive Network**: Provide a space where Black members can connect, share experiences, and support one another in their academic and professional journeys
- **Amplify Voices**: Ensure that the contributions and perspectives of Black researchers are recognized and celebrated within the broader AI community
- **Foster Mentorship**: Facilitate connections between students, researchers, and professionals at different stages of their careers
- **Promote Visibility**: Showcase the excellent work being done by Black researchers at Mila and beyond

## Addressing Systemic Challenges

The creation of Black at Mila is also a response to the systemic barriers that Black individuals often face in academia and tech. By coming together as a community, we can:

- Share resources and knowledge
- Advocate for greater inclusion and equity in AI research
- Create pathways for underrepresented students to enter and succeed in the field
- Challenge the status quo and work toward a more diverse and inclusive AI research community

## Looking Forward

Black at Mila is more than just a community—it's a commitment to ensuring that the future of AI research is diverse, inclusive, and representative of the communities it serves. We believe that by supporting Black researchers and amplifying their contributions, we can help build a stronger, more equitable field of artificial intelligence.

We invite all Black members of the Mila community to join us in this mission, and we welcome allies who share our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in AI research.
